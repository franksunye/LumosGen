## üîÑ Why Archived?

These documents were created during our initial PoC phase when LumosGen was positioned as a general documentation automation tool. After validating the core technology, we pivoted to focus on:

- **Marketing AI Agent** instead of general documentation
- **Global developer market** instead of general users
- **English-first approach** for MVP validation
- **GitHub Pages deployment** for simplicity
